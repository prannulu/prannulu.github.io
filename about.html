  <h2>My journey from Sri Lanka to San Diego</h2>
  <p>
  I was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka. It is a beautiful island with a troubled past, riddled with civil unrest, conflict and economic troubles.
   At the age of 17, I moved to the United States of America by myself to pursue my undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland.
  There, I had the priviledge of studying two subjects that have always peaked my interest: mathematics and physics. 
  After graduating with my Bachelors with Honors in 2018, I moved to San Diego, CA, to pursue my first full-time role. I was a Student Services Specialist at Art of Problem Solving, an online math school.
  I worked there for over 3 years, while simultaneously cultivating a community of queer and trans folks in the local area.
  In February 2022, I left my  job to explore how to be more intentionally involved in this community and to figure out my next career steps.
  My passion for problem solving and social justice led me to Ada Developers Academy, where I started learning coding with like-minded folks around the country.

  <h2>My journey into programming</h2>
  <p>
    My interest in programming began when I took the “Object-Oriented Programming I” class in college. I excelled at it, and I was eager to learn more. But feeling unsupported in my program, I had to put a pause on my programming career. My interest was reignited when my partner applied for a coding bootcamp last year. Looking through her notes, I was reminded of how much I enjoyed programming in college. 
  </p>
  <p>
  This reminder moved me to more seriously invest in coding as my future career. More specifically, I recently began working part-time so that I could dedicate time to self-learning coding. I’ve been working through the JavaScript course on CodeAcademy, supplementing it with freecodecamp.org and other online resources. I’ve also worked through the Ada Build Curriculum. While it is possible to become a self-taught programmer, I would strongly benefit from the structure and assistance that Ada provides. My intention is to continue learning until the start of the program so that I’m prepared for the rigor and challenge that Ada brings.

  Soon after graduating with my BS in Math, I got a tattoo that says QED (“quod erat demonstrandum”). This phrase is written at the end of a mathematical proof to indicate its completion. It loosely means “I proved what I set out to”. I wanted to remember that exhilarating feeling I got from creating an elegant, logically complete solution which may have taken hours or days to produce. In proof-based mathematics, you start with a goal and a set of tools in hand, and you have to use those tools tactfully and creatively to reach that goal. Programming is the same – at its core, it brings me the same joy that mathematics does, and allows me to use those problem-solving skills to create solutions to real world problems.

  <h2>Why I want to be a Software Engineer</h2>
  <p>
    Growing up in Sri Lanka, the latest technologies were “fairytales” I learned about on the news. After eight years in the U.S., I had grown so accustomed to the availability of these very technologies at my fingertips that visiting Sri Lanka last month felt like traveling back a decade. It’s hard to fathom that nearly half the global population doesn’t have internet access. Unless the worsening digital divide is addressed, technological innovations will continue to exclude those that could greatly benefit from its transformational potential. I want to become a software developer to not only shape humanity’s trajectory through technology, but also to close that global digital divide for a more inclusive and equitable digital future.
